OAuth (Open Authorization) provides several flows (or "grant types") to accommodate different kinds of applications and access scenarios. Here's a detailed overview of the **main OAuth 2.0 flows** based on application configurations:

---

## 🔐 1. Authorization Code Flow (with or without PKCE)

### 🧩 Use Case:

* **Confidential clients** like web apps running on a server (e.g., Django, Node.js).
* Also used in **native/mobile apps** when paired with **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange).

### 🔄 Flow Summary:

1. User is redirected to the authorization server (login + consent).
2. Server returns an **authorization code** to the app.
3. App sends this code to the **token endpoint** to exchange it for an **access token** (and optionally a refresh token).

### 🔐 Security:

* Very secure when client secrets are used (server-side).
* With **PKCE**, it becomes secure even for public clients (like mobile apps).

---

## 📦 2. Client Credentials Flow

### 🧩 Use Case:

* **Machine-to-machine** (M2M) communication (no user context).
* Background jobs, CLI tools, microservices.

### 🔄 Flow Summary:

1. The client authenticates with the token endpoint using its **client ID and secret**.
2. Receives an **access token**.

### 🔐 Security:

* Safe if the client credentials are stored securely.
* No user involvement.

---

## 🔄 3. Implicit Flow (Deprecated for most use)

### 🧩 Use Case:

* **Browser-based apps (SPAs)** where tokens were previously returned in the URL fragment.

### ❗ Status:

* **Deprecated** in favor of Authorization Code Flow with PKCE due to security issues (exposed tokens in URLs, no refresh tokens).

---

## 📲 4. Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Flow

### 🧩 Use Case:

* Legacy systems or highly-trusted apps where the user **directly provides credentials** to the app.

### 🔄 Flow Summary:

1. App collects **username + password**.
2. Sends them to the token endpoint.
3. Gets back an access token.

### ⚠️ Risk:

* **Avoid** unless absolutely necessary—credentials exposure risk.
* Not recommended by OAuth 2.1.

---

## 📦 5. Device Authorization Flow (Device Code Flow)

### 🧩 Use Case:

* Devices with **limited input capabilities** (e.g., TVs, game consoles).

### 🔄 Flow Summary:

1. Device displays a code and asks the user to visit a verification URL on another device.
2. User logs in and enters the code.
3. Device polls the token endpoint to get the access token.

### ✅ Good for:

* OAuth with smart TVs, CLI tools, IoT.

---

## 📦 6. JWT Bearer Token Flow (SAML or Assertion Grant)

### 🧩 Use Case:

* **Federated identity** scenarios.
* Where the client has an **existing signed JWT** or SAML assertion.

### 🔄 Flow Summary:

1. A JWT (or SAML assertion) is submitted to the token endpoint.
2. An access token is returned.

### 🔐 Security:

* Often used in **SSO** integrations or backend service delegation.
